Zinc
====

[![Build Status](https://ci.scala-lang.org/api/badges/scalacenter/zinc/status.svg)](https://ci.scala-lang.org/scalacenter/zinc)

This fork is Scala Center's fork of the incremental compiler. This fork has
some strict rules:

1. Every noteworthy implemented feature needs to be upstreamed to sbt/zinc.
2. This repository is mainly a playground to experiment and agree on the stability of a change.
3. This repository is allowed to contain Bloop-specific changes to the incremental compiler.

This repository is only meant to be used by Bloop developers. For more information
about the project and its origins, visit [sbt/zinc](https://github.com/sbt/zinc).
